  <p>My name is Mc Laurence G. Fetiluna</p>
  <p>This is a webpage I created using HTML as my own blog, or a digital journal of some sorts.
    I have been fascinated for years of writing in my own diary and/or journal with my own aesthetic
    notebook, but I never really got into a groove with it. Try as I might I never really developed
    a habit of writing at a consistent time.
