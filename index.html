  <p>My name is Mc Laurence G. Fetiluna</p>
  <p>This is a webpage I created using HTML as my own blog, or a digital journal of some sorts.
    I have been fascinated for years of writing in my own diary and/or journal with my own aesthetic
    notebook, but I never really got into a groove with it. Try as I might I never really developed
    a habit of writing at a consistent time. So to make this more convinient, I will just write my thoughts 
   here in the digital blog since I mostly use the laptop anyway if there isn't any school for the day.

   Blogs will be listed here with the posts be labeled with dates for organization sake.
