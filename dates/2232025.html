<h1>February 23, 2025</h1>

<p>This is my second blog.</p>
<p>I had a thought suddenly while in the process of writing today's blog. Who am I writing this for, exactly? Who am I addressing? I'll write when I find an answer.</p>
<p>SO today, not much has happened. I woke up randomly in the early hours of the morning and noticei still have one of my earphones on and the other has been detached from my ear. I searched the entirebed for that one earbud. When I found it, I placed the pair into their case and charged the phone. I went back to sleep.<br>
<br>
I woke up again at somewhere 6am. How I managed to fuck up my sleep rhythm this much astounds me. I cannot recall EXACTLY what I did. I feel- no, I KNOW my memory is getting worse. im slipping. I should find the cause and remedy for this problem. Worse case scenario, its ADHD, Dementia, or aLzhiemers. At best its my negligence. <br>
<br>
Anyways, for the morning, I immediately placed the electric fan and phone from my bedroom all the way down to the living room. after I just played with angry birds, Minecraft, and Left for dead on my slow-ass windows 7 laptop. Uncle also told me he will be gone for a week so I need to take care of the house and the keys. I continue to play with the games all morning. I am grateful to Internet archive for having the digital copies of angry birds in their library.<br>
<br>
on another note, is my application to CIT-U, and two scholarships; SM and the city's. I still have to apply to the college and pass requirements for SM and the City scholarship. Its a shame and it annoys me to the highest degree that both the online portals for CIT-u and SM are both broken! it could have made my life SO MUCH easier! But since their site is broken, I hae to physically visit CIT-U's campus, DepED, and wait for SM to fix their online portal. hopefully I can get this shit done by Tuesday.<br>
<br>
I have been told by my classmate who applied and is now enrolled to CIT-u that the process was easy and swift for him because of his high grades. he didn't even need to take the exam and interview. he was enrolled after he paid the amount which I assume was the 1500php. the college did say that if an applicant has 92% or above grades, they don't NEED to take the exam. I have 95. beats having to wait for an application letter *ahem *ahem* <b>UP</b> *ahem* *ahem*.<br>
<br>
I now just finished organizing my requirements for each Im applying to right now and iM writing this blog with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse connected to my phone. IN a few minutes (hours) I will fall asleep.</p>
