<p>hello again. I have come to write again today. This day is one of <em>THOSE</em> days..</p>

<p>Next week will be our exam period. But it will not be the only problem I have. Turns out, I have mis clicked a option during CIT-U's step 2: Google form. instead of clicking the option telling the College I will and have passed the requirements in person in their campus -to the OAS-i have clicked the ONLINE option of passing the requirements. This has implications. Does this mean nothing? after all they have mycopy of the requirements, they saw it themselves or do I have to pass the requirements oNLINE even if I already did it in person? How does this muddle up my application process to CIT.

There's also the problem of my scholarship applications. I haven't passed any of the requirements because they need files from my parents. Since the 2 as separated now, it is hard to coordinate with them. they are a hindrance to my scholarship applications and therefore an obstacle to my future. Therefore I aim to repay that. When I grow up, rich or otherwise, they will be spending their yea in a retirement home.
</p>

<p>also, I mentioned an exam. to be exact, it will happen on Thursday and Friday. SO I have to study starting tomorrow. although, I have missing notes in ENtrep and EMpowerment among others because I ran out of yellow paper to take notes. I should ask for notes.<?p>

<p>bUt the most irritating is that stupid, son of a bitch.. I don't know what to call him. uncle? no. God no. Maybe i'LL address him as an aunt's bf? sidekick? I don't care. No matter what he is to her, to the family, heis a pain in my ass. that arrogant and demanding son of a bitch. When he wants something or involved in something, he <b><I>REALLY</i></b> wants to be involved. From asking questions to others, to people cleaning the Aircon, the people working on the neighbor's house, forcing himself there. When he really is involved, like told to do something -like a puppy- he is excited to do it, might as well wag his tail while he is at it. THEN, when it's convenient, he asks me to do the thing he is so happy to be tasked with. 
Ex.
Aunt asked him to ask me and my mother where a gadget is. Suddenly he wants it NOW. HE DEMANDS it! aPorador kaayo. Then if I'm too "slow" or do something to still achieve the task but not the way he told me, he loses it. Suddenly IM lazy.

nothing can stop him from ordering everyone around because he is the owner of the house now ever since the true owners of the house (my grandparents) passed away. all because he has a "situationship" with my aunt.

but when it comes to him doing a task, heis so SLOW! Always finding excuses why he is not and/or will not do it. "bAH! stUPid! Why bother" kinda attitude

WHERES MY CHAIR ASSHOLE? THE ONE YOU BROUGHT TO THENEIGHBOR'S HOUSE AND NEVER RETURNED IT? MASSIVEHYPOCRITE!!</p>
