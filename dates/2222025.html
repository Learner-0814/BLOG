  <h1>February 22, 2025</h1>
  <p>So this is my first entry into my blog. I have tried so many methods of documenting my days and thoughts, from writing in an aesthetic book, to making audio logs.
  But no matter what, I never developed a rythm or habit into making them consistently. Hopefully this will be easier to do since it is more convinient because I keep 
  using my laptop anyways whenever Im in the house. <br>
  My laptop specs is:
  <ul>
    <li>OS: Windows 7</li>
    <li>CPU: Intel Core i3-2310 (2.10GHz)</li>
    <li>RAM: 4GB</li>
    <li>GPU: Intel HD 3000 (1GB VRAM)</li>
  </ul>
  Im considering upgrading to a desktop computer for gaming. I already have the idea of the components and specs I want for the PC as well as saving money (and grades).
  Based on the PC building videos I hve seen, I have the vague idea for a 'prototype' <br>
  This is the list: (This is subject to change)
  <ul>
    <li>Monitor: 1080p (atleast 60Hz)</li>
    <li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 2600</li>
    <li>Motherboard: B450M, B550, B660</li>
    <li>RAM: 16GB (dual channel), DDR4, 36666MHz</li>
    <li>GPU: GTX 960(4GB), GTX 1050(ti),GTX 1080, GTX 1080ti</li>
    <li>Storage: 256GB nvme 2.0 and 1TB HDD</li>
  </ul>
  The following specs for the PC has been adjusted to play GTA 5, Red Redemption 2 and Battlefield 1 on atleast medium settings for 60fps+. I think the specs are atleast mid range so
  it can handle old AAA games like GTA 5 at more than 60fps even on high settings while also being able to play more demanding games like Battlefield 1 and RDR2 on medium settings atleast
  in a comfortable 50/60fps. Although, I think 960 and 1050 being unable to play RDR2 due to its age and outdated specs. I decided to consult chatgpt while keeping in mind that its not 
  100% accurate.

  ### **System Performance Summary**  

#### **Components & Performance Overview**  
- **Monitor:** 1080p or 1440p (at least 60Hz) – Best paired with GTX 1080 or above for smooth performance.  
- **CPU:** **AMD Ryzen 5 2600** – Decent for gaming but may bottleneck at high FPS in CPU-heavy games.  
- **Motherboard:** **B450M / B550 / B660** – Supports Ryzen 5 2600 and offers good expansion options.  
- **RAM:** **16GB DDR4 3600MHz (Dual Channel)** – Good for gaming; optimal speed for Ryzen is **3200MHz**.  
- **GPU:** **Varies (GTX 960, 1050 Ti, 1080, 1080 Ti)** – Determines game performance (see table below).  
- **Storage:** **256GB NVMe + 1TB HDD** – Fast boot times and ample space for games, but RDR2 and GTA 5 need SSD space for best loading times.

### **GPU Performance Table (1080p & 1440p Gaming)**  
| **GPU**          | **Red Dead Redemption 2** (RDR2) | **GTA 5** | **Battlefield 1** |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **GTX 1050 Ti** (4GB) | **1080p Low: 25-35 FPS** | **1080p Med-High: 40-50 FPS** | **1080p Med: 40-50 FPS** |
| **GTX 960** (4GB) | **1080p Low-Med: 30-45 FPS** | **1080p High: 50-60 FPS** | **1080p High: 50-60 FPS** |
| **GTX 1080** | **1080p High: 55-65 FPS** <br> **1440p Med-High: 40-50 FPS** | **1080p Very High: 100+ FPS** <br> **1440p High: 70-90 FPS** | **1080p Ultra: 100+ FPS** <br> **1440p High: 70-90 FPS** |
| **GTX 1080 Ti** | **1080p Ultra: 70+ FPS** <br> **1440p High: 50-60 FPS** | **1080p Ultra: 120+ FPS** <br> **1440p Very High: 90-110 FPS** | **1080p Ultra: 120+ FPS** <br> **1440p Ultra: 90+ FPS** |

### **Conclusion & Recommendations**  
- **GTX 1050 Ti & GTX 960** – Struggle with RDR2, playable in GTA 5 & BF1 at 1080p Medium-High. **Not recommended for 1440p gaming.**  
- **GTX 1080** – Best for **1080p Ultra or 1440p High gaming** with solid FPS across all games.  
- **GTX 1080 Ti** – **Best overall** choice from your list, handles **1440p gaming well** and pushes **100+ FPS in older games** like GTA 5 and BF1.  
- **Upgrade Suggestion:** **RTX 2060 or GTX 1660 Super** for better performance & future-proofing.
