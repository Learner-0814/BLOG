  <h1>February 22, 2025</h1>
  <p>So this is my first entry into my blog. I have tried so many methods of documenting my days and thoughts, from writing in an aesthetic book, to making audio logs.
  But no matter what, I never developed a rythm or habit into making them consistently. Hopefully this will be easier to do since it is more convinient because I keep 
  using my laptop anyways whenever Im in the house. <br>
  My laptop specs is:
  <ul>
    <li>OS: Windows 7</li>
    <li>CPU: Intel Core i3-2310 (2.10GHz)</li>
    <li>RAM: 4GB</li>
    <li>GPU: Intel HD 3000 (1GB VRAM)</li>
  </ul>
  Im considering upgrading to a desktop computer for gaming. I already have the idea of the components and specs I want for the PC as well as saving money (and grades).
  Based on the PC building videos I hve seen, I have the vague idea for a 'prototype' <br>
  This is the list: (This is subject to change)
  <ul>
    <li>Monitor: 1080p (atleast 60Hz)</li>
    <li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 2600</li>
    <li>Motherboard: B450M, B550, B660</li>
    <li>RAM: 16GB (dual channel), DDR4, 36666MHz</li>
    <li>GPU: GTX 960(4GB), GTX 1050(ti),GTX 1080, GTX 1080ti</li>
    <li>Storage: 256GB nvme 2.0 and 1TB HDD</li>
  </ul>
  The following specs for the PC has been adjusted to play GTA 5, Red Redemption 2 and Battlefield 1 on atleast medium settings for 60fps+. I think the specs are atleast mid range so
  it can handle old AAA games like GTA 5 at more than 60fps even on high settings while also being able to play more demanding games like Battlefield 1 and RDR2 on medium settings atleast
  in a comfortable 50/60fps. Although, I think 960 and 1050 being unable to play RDR2 due to its age and outdated specs. I decided to consult chatgpt while keeping in mind that its not 
  100% accurate.<br>
<br>
 <h3>System Performance Summary</h3>
<h4>Components & Performance Overview</h4>
  <ul>
<li>Monitor: 1080p or 1440p (at least 60Hz) – Best paired with GTX 1080 or above for smooth performance.</li>
<li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 2600 – Decent for gaming but may bottleneck at high FPS in CPU-heavy games.
<li>Motherboard: B450M / B550 / B660 – Supports Ryzen 5 2600 and offers good expansion options.
<li>RAM: 16GB DDR4 3600MHz (Dual Channel) – Good for gaming; optimal speed for Ryzen is 3200MHz.
<li>GPU: Varies (GTX 960, 1050 Ti, 1080, 1080 Ti) – Determines game performance (see table below).
<li>Storage: 256GB NVMe + 1TB HDD – Fast boot times and ample space for games, but RDR2 and GTA 5 need SSD space for best loading times.
  </ul>

        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>GPU</th>

                <td>1080p Ultra: 120+ FPS</td>

            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    
<p>So in short, I am planning to buy a mid-range budget gaming PC that can handle old AAA games and modern-ish (2010-2019)games atleast on medium settings at 60fps+. Im already
planning the different components to suit my general use of the computer and I really had to do extensive research.</p>

<p>With all the research I did on the prototype for my computer, I realized; I had no idea when it came to building computers at all. Im also a 12th grader and looking into colleges
with their own undergraduate programs --and I have been into computer science ever since elementary school even though I did not know EXACTLY what I was going into-- but now,
as a 12th SHS TVL-ICT Computer Programming (Basically computer science)student looking into colleges and their own undergraduate/Baccaluerate Program with their own long list of 
requirements, I have begun to ask myself; "Am I sure I want to continue being a computer science student? Or do I want to switch to BSCPE which is a course about making computers?"
Both has things I like, 'Com. Sci.' is all about software and software development, the thing i have been learning since elementary, even now and have grown attached to. While BSCPE 
is about a new hobby and interest of mine which is building computers and is completely different from Computer Science and switching from Computer Science to BSCPE means 
abandoning what I have learned up until this point about software and learning something ENTIRELY NEW. Why isn't there a course that mixes both?<br>
I also began to seriously switching courses when I learned that computer science will use complicated and theoritical algorithms and mathematics while BCSPE is more hands on
apparently.</p>
