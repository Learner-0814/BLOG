  <h1>February 22, 2025</h1>
  <p>So this is my first entry into my blog. I have tried so many methods of documenting my days and thoughts, from writing in an aesthetic book, to making audio logs.
  But no matter what, I never developed a rythm or habit into making them consistently. Hopefully this will be easier to do since it is more convinient because I keep 
  using my laptop anyways whenever Im in the house. 
  My laptop specs is:
  <ul>
    <li>OS: Windows 7</li>
    <li>CPU: Intel Core i3-2310 (2.10GHz)</li>
    <li>RAM: 4GB</li>
    <li>GPU: Intel HD 3000 (1GB VRAM)</li>
  </ul></p>
