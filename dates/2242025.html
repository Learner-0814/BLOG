<h1>February 24, 2025</h1>
<p>hello once again, reader. I'm writing another blog post today.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1: Assignments</h3>
<p>Since tomorrow; Tuesday, despite being a holiday, my school is forcing everyone to attend classes tomorrow. I hate it. I hate it when a day is supposed to be a holiday but then people from up above forces us to work. They are so high up that they are detached from reality. But no matter how much I hate it, it doesn't change the fact that there is STILL school tomorrow. SO I have to do the tasks assigned to my class since last week that we need to pass tomorrow. CPAR gave us assignment to finish the 3rd task of drawing the 7 elements of art:</p>
<br> 
<ul>
<li>color 
<li>line 
<li>form 
<li>value 
<li>space 
<li>shape 
<li>texture
</ul>

Not to mention that PE gave us a group project for the first task. The CPAR was much more easier to do than the group project for PE -for obvious reasons.

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p>SInce there is school tomorrow, and I have to avoid the big crowds, I have to go out early tomorrow, by 7:30am, I have to be hitting the road. I have to go physically to CIT to apply and hopefully be enrolled just as fast as my classmate because I have high grades so then I can go to DAY-aS and pass my requirements for the cty's scholarship and then go to school before class starts so I can finish my CPAR and PE group projects.</p>
